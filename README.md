# Spaghettification-Python
This is a python program which tells us that how much spherical objects made up of different elements will be stretched up near a black hole (with basic calculations).


NOTE : THIS IS A VERY BASIC MODEL FOR THE VISUALIZATION OF THE EXTREME SPAGHETTIFICATION HAPPEN NEAR A BLACK HOLE. THIS PROGRAM DOESN'T ACCOUNTS FOR THE EXTREME TIDAL FORCES NEAR THE BLACK HOLES AND THE RESULTS OF THIS PROGRAM MIGHT NOT BE VERY ACCURATE BUT STILL IT WILL GIVE A IDEA OF EXTREME SPAGHETTIFICATION NEAR A BLACK HOLE.
